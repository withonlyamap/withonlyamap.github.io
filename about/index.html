  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hello, my name is John Nutter. I&rsquo;ve been working as a customer support technician for an Atlanta based software company for the last 5 years. I have a background in web development, with experience using PHP, Python, and Ruby.</p>

<p>My goal is to find a systems engineering position where I can bring my knowledge of working with Linux based systems; incorporate my knowledge of programming languages to automate various tasks; and apply my love of problem solving and troubleshooting to this role.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not working, I&rsquo;m playing; either on my bass guitar, 80s synthesizers, or various music production software, such as Ableton Live or Reaper. I&rsquo;ve released a few albums over the years, but mostly as a hobby. I also have my own digital, and soon-to-be cassette label.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not working or playing music, I&rsquo;m watching sci-fi television and movies, reading comic books, listening to podcasts, or catching up the latest industry news.</p>
